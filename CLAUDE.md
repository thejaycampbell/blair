# Blair — AI CMO Agent

Blair is a Claude Code agent bundle that handles any marketing ask: strategy, research, campaigns, content, copy, SEO, email, paid media, PR, sales enablement, and performance analytics.

## Getting Started

**First time:**
```
/blair:start
```
Blair will ask you 6 questions about your brand, then write a persistent profile to `.claude/cmo/brand.md`. Every future session uses that profile automatically.

**After setup — just ask:**
> "Write me a launch email sequence"
> "Who are my competitors and how do I position against them?"
> "Build me a 30-day LinkedIn content plan"
> "Audit my homepage"
> "Review this email draft"

## Your Brand Profile

Stored at `.claude/cmo/brand.md` — gitignored by default (your strategy stays private). See `.claude/cmo/brand.md.example` for what a completed profile looks like.

## Persistent Context Files

Blair reads these files at the start of every session. They are what makes Blair more useful the longer it runs.

| File | What it is | How it grows |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/cmo/brand.md` | Brand profile | Set up via `/blair:start`, updated via `/blair:update` |
| `.claude/cmo/campaigns.md` | Campaign log | Auto-appended after every campaign design |
| `.claude/cmo/insights.md` | Performance log | Auto-appended after every analytics review |
| `.claude/cmo/marquee.md` | Locked messaging | Set via `blair-strategist` Marquee Messaging Lock |
| `.claude/cmo/learnings.md` | Correction and preference log | Auto-appended by `blair-learn` |
| `.claude/cmo/stakeholders.md` | Relationship context | User-written; copy from `stakeholders.md.example` |

## Campaign Log

Blair appends to `.claude/cmo/campaigns.md` after each campaign design. This prevents repeated work across sessions and lets Blair reference past campaigns for context.

## Performance Log

`blair-analytics` appends to `.claude/cmo/insights.md` after each performance review — building a running record of what's been tried and what's been learned.
